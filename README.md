### Hello âœ¨  I am Daniel Gomez!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently pioneering an AI app (Gomera) that can facilitate robotic-assisted neuroendovascular surgery (NES) for aneurysm subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) healing via an optimized drug eluting biomedical device for the coil embolization procedure. 

- My graduate studies is in Struct Mol Bio (SMB), Microbio & Immuno (M&I), Cancer Biology (CB), and my thesis is on the Virophysics of a molecular nanomachine as a promising antiviral target for drug design, discovery, and development

- I am authoring papers right now on synthetic and sturctural vaccinology (SSV), immunotherapy, advances in gene and cell therapy, and bioengineering.

- I have launched several CROs: 

- I am the Founder & CEO at <a href=https://gome.bio>Gome Bio LLC</a>, @gomebio <br> 

- I am the Founding Executive Director at <a href=https://gomera.io>Gomera Health Inc.</a><br>
Advanced DNA Chemistry, Structure and Computation for Immunoreagents, Diagnostics to Vaccines, Deep Medicine, 
Surgical Data Science (SDS), AI in Surgery, and Digital Pathology

- I am the Founder & Board Chair at <a href=https://gomewritings.org>Gome Writings </a>(nonprofit) <br>
"Writing Genomes" 

- I am an Academic Editor for the MDPI journal <i> Cancers </i> <br>
Special Issue: Neuro-oncology and neurotrauma

- I actively research the field of Structural Biology, M&I, and Neuroendovascular Surgery (NES) 

- I am a Virophysics, Molecular and Structural Biology Graduate Student at CSUEB and my thesis research is at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) SLAC National Accelerator Center and UCSF Crystallography Facility

- I am a Graduate Student Associate at Drexel University College of Medicine (Microbiology & Immunology, Neurobiology and Anatomy)
