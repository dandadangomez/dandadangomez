### Hello ‚ú® I am Daniel Gomez, an innovative üë®‚Äçüî¨ Molecular Biologist, Computational Biologist and Engineer üë®‚Äçüíª!

- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Daniel J. Gomez, a graduate researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, exercise immunology, computational/systems cancer biology, spatial immunotherapy, precision medicine, and evidence-based medicine.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning computational cancer genetics, exercise immunology, and multimodal spatial and big data omics approaches.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm doing research and development, and analytics in basic and translational research for multiple consortia MoTrPAC, HuBMAP, HTAN, PsychENCODE, and All of Us Researchers.

- üòÑ Pronouns: he/him/his
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I won 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place in grappling/jiu-jitsu competitions, played football, soccer, volleyball, played piano, clarinet, saxophone, guitar, 1st violin, 2nd violin, and did academic research in 6 different medical schools and 1 veterinary medical college (Stanford Medicine, JABSOM, JHUSOM, UCSDSOM, DUCOM, UFCVM).


My <a href="https://dangomez.pro">Academic profile</a> is here for your viewing pleasure üß≠ üåé.

- üó∫Ô∏è My present graduate studies is in Molecular and Cellular Atlases, Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics. Single-Cell RNA Sequencing, Deep Omics Profiling in Health and Disease, AI/ML Data Science and Cloud Computing in Precision Medicine, Biomedicine, Genetics and Genomics, Multiomics, Translational Medicine, Immunology, Pathogenomics and Computational Biology. Currently, I am doing my thesis research in mapping exerkines in spatially resolved multiomics in preclinical models and the human body, exercise and physical activity, multiomics, interorgan communication, signal transduction networks, and building multiscale single-cell spatial profiles of interorgan crosstalk at single-cell resolution, near-single cell super-resolution, and connect cell-cell interactions with ligand-receptor pairs and their functions inside the cell that display the effect of exerkines measured in health, resilience and disease.
