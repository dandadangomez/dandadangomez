### Hello ‚ú® I am Daniel Gomez, a visionary üë®‚Äçüíª Molecular Biologist and Bioinformatician üë®‚Äçüî¨!

- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Daniel J. Gomez, a researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine (SUSOM).
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in computational & systems immunology, evidence-based and precision medicine.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning cancer genetics and multimodal omics approaches.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm doing big data in basic and translational cancer research for MoTrPAC, HuBMAP, HTAN, PsychENCODE, and All of Us Researchers.

- üòÑ Pronouns: he/him/his
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I won 1st, 2nd, 3rd place in grappling/jiu-jitsu competitions, played football, soccer, volleyball, played clarinet, saxophone, guitar, violin, and did academic research in 5 different medical schools and 1 veterinary medical college (JABSOM, JHUSOM, UCSDSOM, SUSOM, DUCOM, UFCVM).


My <a href="https://djgomezsantos.github.io">Academic profile</a> is here for your viewing pleasure üß≠ üåé.

- üó∫Ô∏è My present graduate studies is in Molecular and Cellular Atlases, Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics. Single-Cell RNA Sequencing, Deep Omics Profiling in Health and Disease, AI/ML Data Science and Cloud Computing in Precision Medicine, Biomedicine, Genetics and Genomics, Multiomics, Translational Medicine, Immunology, Pathogenomics and Computational Biology.

- Currently, I am doing my thesis research in exerkine mapping in preclinical models and the human body, exercise and physical activity, multiomics, interorgan communication, signal transduction networks, and building multiscale spatial atlases of interorgan crosstalk at single-cell resolution, near-single cell super-resolution, and connect cell-cell interactions with ligand-receptor interactions and their functions inside the cell that display the effect of exerkines measured in health, resilience and disease.
