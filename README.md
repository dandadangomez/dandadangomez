- I work on next-gen biotech, immuno(bio)engineering, structural biology, CAD, CMS, & AI/ML/DL/RL

- I have launched CROs: 

- I am the Founder & CEO at Gome Bio LLC, @gomebio (gome.bio) <br> 
"Teaching the brain and immune system to fight disease together"  <br>
Individualized Neuro-Immune Medicine. 

- I am the Founder & Director at Gomera Health Inc. <br>
Advanced DNA Chemistry, Nanomedicine, and AI for Autonomous Molecular Design

- I am the Founder & Board Chair at Gome Writings (nonprofit) <br>
"Writing Genomes" 

- I am an Academic Editor for <i> Cancers </i> MDPI journal <br>
Special Issue: Neuro-oncology and neurotrauma

- I actively research the field of Structural Biology, Neuropathology, & MSSE (CMS)
- I am a Structural Molecular Biology (SMB) Graduate Student at CSUEB and Bioengineering student at Stanford Bioengineering Schools of Engineering and Medicine, and my thesis research is at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) and UCSF Crystallography Facility
- I am a Graduate Student Associate at Drexel University College of Medicine (Microbiology & Immunology, Neurobiology and Anatomy)
