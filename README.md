### Hello âœ¨ I am Daniel!

My personal webiste is <a href="https://www.danieljgomez.net">here</a>.

- ðŸ”­ My graduate studies in MCB and research has been in multiple areas and fields of Medicine: Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology, and Pharmacology, Cell and Molecular Biology, Cancer, Infectious Disease, Bioengineering, Structural Biology, and Genetics.
- Presently, I am doing my thesis research in Multiomics and Molecular Exercise Physiology and Precision Exercise Medicine. 

Research Interests:
- Exerkines and Exercise Responsomes
- Mechanisms that underlie the benefits of exercise (exercise science research)
- Exercise Biochemistry and Exercise Molecular Biology

- Computational Precision Medicine (Clinical Science)
- Multi-omics multi-tissue molecular mapping (Tissue- and Organism-Wide Multi-omics)

- Cancer Neuroscience
- Biological cryogenic electron microscopy and tomography 
- Clinical Neuroimmunology
- Tumors Immune Microenvironments (TiME)
- Molecular Bioengineering, Nanotechnology, Nanomedicine



Technique Interests:
- Spatial Multi-Omics and Multiplex Imaging
- Single-cell biology (scATACseq, scRNAseq, snRNAseq, etc)
- Developing analytical tools to harness both high-dimensional single-cell phenotype data and spatial info
- Spatial analysis of tissue architecture & cellular niches
- Annotating spatially resolved single-cell data by spatial cell learning
- Surgical Data Science (AI, ML, DL, RL) and Deep Medicine
- Molecular neuroimmune-pathology, psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), neuroimmunopharmacology (NIP)
- Neuroimmune connectome, neuropathology and neuroimaging modalities (PET, fMRI BOLD, dMRI, DWI, FLAIR, DTI, PWI, MEG, HARDI, Q-balls)
- multimodal neuronavigation 
- Morphology and imaging (histology, live-cell, in vivo microscopy)
