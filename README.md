### Hello âœ¨  I am Daniel Gomez-Santos!

- ðŸ”­ My graduate studies is in Cancer Research, Biochemistry and Biophysics (BB), Microbiology & Immunology (M&I), and I work on Epitope-based Vaccines (EBVs) of infection-related and non-infection-related cancers by discovering promising antiviral targets for drug design, discovery, and development

- As a industrialist, I have launched several CROs: 

- I am the Founder & CEO at <a href=https://gome.bio>Gome Bio LLC</a>, @gomebio <br> 

- I am the President and Founding Executive Director at <a href=https://gomera.io>Gomera Health Inc.</a><br>
Advanced DNA Chemistry, Structure and Computation for Immunoreagents, Diagnostics to Vaccines, Deep Medicine, 
Surgical Data Science (SDS), AI in Surgery, and Digital Pathology

- I am the Founder & Board Chair at <a href=https://gomewritings.org>Gome Writings </a>(nonprofit) <br>
"Writing Genomes" 

- I am an Academic Editor for the MDPI journal <i> Cancers </i> <br>
Special Issue: Neuro-oncology and neurotrauma

- I actively research the field of Structural Biology, M&I, and Neuroendovascular Surgery (NES)
