### Hello âœ¨ I am Daniel!

My website is <a href="https://www.danieljgomez.org"> here</a> and this is my <a href="https://gomezdj.github.io">GitHub Portfolio</a>.

- ðŸ”­ My present graduate studies is in AI/ML, and LLMs in Genetics and Genomics, Spatial Biology, Optical Science, Multiomics, Genome Bioinformatics, Immunometabolism and Computational Biology

- My previous research has been in multiple areas and fields of Medicine: Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology, Pharmacology, Cell and Molecular Biology, Microbiology and Immunology, Structural Biology, Infectious Disease, Bioengineering, and Cancer Biology.

- Currently, I am doing my thesis research in exercise medicine, multiomics, interorgan communication, creating interactive signaling networks that build interorgan spatial maps at single-cell resolution that display measured performance of exerkines in health, resilence and disease.
