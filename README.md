### Hello âœ¨  I am Daniel!

- ðŸ”­ My graduate studies and research has been in Cancer, Co-infections, Structural Biology, Bioengineering, Molecular Biology and Genomics. Currently, I am doing my thesis research in exercise molecular biology.

- As a industrialist, I have launched a start-up:
  
- I am the President and Founding Executive Director at <a href=https://gomera.io>Gomera Health Inc.</a><br>
"Identify new cures, advanced diagnostics, effective therapeutics, and surgical innovations"
The goal is to provide these:
Advanced DNA Chemistry, Structure and Computation for Immunoreagents, Diagnostics to Therapeutics, Deep Medicine, 
Surgical Data Science (SDS), AI in Surgery, and Digital Pathology

- I also volunteer as a Virtual Associate Fellow at Drexel University College of Medicine (Microbiology & Immunology, Neurobiology and Anatomy)

- Clinical Medicine
- Cancer Neuroscience and Immunotherapy: Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics
- Biological cryogenic electron microscopy and tomography 
- Metabolomics (plasma, serum, tissue extracts)
- Molecular Structural Biology - Organelle Structural Biology
- Structural bioinformatics


- Multiplex imaging through multi-omics 
- Spatial analysis of tissue architecture & cellular niches
- Spatial Multi-Omics
- Annotating spatially resolved single-cell data by spatial cell learning
- Developing analytical tools to harness both high-dimensional single-cell phenotype data and spatial info
- Neuroimmunology and Tumors Immune Microenvironments (TiME)
- Designing and engineering multiscale biological, synthetic, and molecular circuits
- Deep generative molecular design in drug discovery (hybrid data models, multimodal generative models)

- Biomedical ML Engineering, Structural and Computational Biophysics, and Cancer Research
- Surgical Data Science (AI, ML, DL, RL) and Deep Medicine
- Molecular neuroimmune-pathology, psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), neuroimmunopharmacology (NIP)
- Conductome, neuroimmune connectome, neuropathology and neuroimaging modalities (PET, fMRI BOLD, dMRI, DWI, FLAIR, DTI, PWI, MEG, HARDI, Q-balls) multimodal neuronavigation 
- Morphology and imaging (histology, live-cell, in vivo microscopy)

- Next-generation Biotechnology and Modern Molecular Cell Biology
- Single-cell biology (scATACseq, scRNAseq, snRNAseq, etc)

- Programming: Go, Python, R
