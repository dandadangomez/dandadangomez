### Hello âœ¨ I am Daniel!

My personal webiste is <a href="https://www.danieljgomez.net">here</a>.

- ðŸ”­ My present graduate studies is in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) and my previous research has been in multiple areas and fields of Medicine: Tropical Medicine, Medical Microbiology, and Pharmacology, Cell and Molecular Biology, Microbiology and Immunology, Cancer Biology, Infectious Disease, Bioengineering, Structural Biology, and now Genetics.
- Presently, I am doing my thesis research in Exercise multiomics, network biology, and molecular mapping. 

Research Interests:
- Exerkines and Exercise
- Mechanisms that underlie the benefits of exercise (exercise science research)
- Exercise Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Physiology
- Precision Medicine to Network Medicine
- Multi-omics multi-tissue molecular mapping (Tissue- and Organism-Wide Multi-omics)
- Molecular Bioengineering, Nanotechnology, Nanomedicine, and Cell and Gene Thereapy

Technique Interests:
- Genomics and Proteomics, Metabolomics (multiomics), Structural Variations and Predictions
- Systems Biology and Applications 
- Biological Modeling and Evaluation, Drug Development
- Data visualization, Data analysis, Data mining
- Biological and Disease Modeling (AI/ML/DL)
- Computational biology 
- Spatial Multi-Omics and Multiplex Imaging
- Single-cell biology (scATACseq, scRNAseq, snRNAseq, etc)
- Developing analytical tools to harness both high-dimensional single-cell phenotype data and spatial info
- Spatial analysis of tissue architecture & cellular niches
- Annotating spatially resolved single-cell data by spatial cell learning
- Molecular neuroimmune-pathology, psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), neuroimmunopharmacology (NIP)
- Neuroimmune connectome, neuropathology and neuroimaging modalities (PET, fMRI BOLD, dMRI, DWI, FLAIR, DTI, PWI, MEG, HARDI, Q-balls)
- multimodal neuronavigation for neurosurgery, ie BrainLab
- Morphology and imaging (histology, live-cell, all kinds of microscopy)
