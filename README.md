### Hello âœ¨ I am Daniel!

- ðŸ”­ My graduate studies and research has been in Cancer, Co-infections, Structural Biology, Bioengineering, Molecular Biology and Genomics. Currently, I am doing my thesis research in exercise molecular biology.

- As a industrialist, I have launched a start-up:
  
- I am the President and Founding Executive Director at <a href=https://gomerahealth.com>Gomera Health Inc.</a><br>
"Identify new cures, advanced diagnostics, effective therapeutics, and surgical innovations"
The goal is to provide these:
Advanced DNA Chemistry, Structure and Computation for Immunoreagents, Diagnostics to Therapeutics, Deep Medicine, 
Surgical Data Science (SDS), AI in Surgery, and Digital Pathology

- I also volunteer as a Virtual Associate Fellow at Drexel University College of Medicine (Microbiology & Immunology, Neurobiology and Anatomy)

Interests:
- Mechanisms that underlie the benefits of exercise (exercise science research)
- Next-generation Biotechnology and Modern Molecular Cell Biology
- Mapping molecular responses in whole organisms
- Multi-omics multi-tissue mapping ("Tissue- and Organism-Wide 2D/3D Multi-omics")
- Deep Omics Profiling

- Spatial Multi-Omics and Multiplex Imaging
- Single-cell biology (scATACseq, scRNAseq, snRNAseq, etc)
- Developing analytical tools to harness both high-dimensional single-cell phenotype data and spatial info
- Spatial analysis of tissue architecture & cellular niches
- Annotating spatially resolved single-cell data by spatial cell learning
  
- Cancer Neuroscience and Immunotherapy
- Biological cryogenic electron microscopy and tomography 
- Molecular Structural Biology - Organelle Structural Biology
- Bioinformatics
- Clinical Medicine
- Neuroimmunology and Tumors Immune Microenvironments (TiME)
- Designing and engineering multiscale biological, synthetic, and molecular circuits
- Deep generative molecular design in drug discovery (hybrid data models, multimodal generative models)

- Biomedical ML Engineering, Structural and Computational Biophysics, and Cancer Research
- Surgical Data Science (AI, ML, DL, RL) and Deep Medicine
- Molecular neuroimmune-pathology, psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), neuroimmunopharmacology (NIP)
- Conductome, neuroimmune connectome, neuropathology and neuroimaging modalities (PET, fMRI BOLD, dMRI, DWI, FLAIR, DTI, PWI, MEG, HARDI, Q-balls) multimodal neuronavigation 
- Morphology and imaging (histology, live-cell, in vivo microscopy)

- Programming: Go, Python, R
